        <p class="about-me-content">
        
            Hi, I'm Karyssa Miller, and I recently graduated from Tech Elevator with a focus on becoming a Junior Software Engineer. I primarily work with Java using IntelliJ to build maintainable and scalable applications. I also use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within Visual Studio Code to develop user-friendly frontends and dynamic websites.
            <br>
            For databases, I rely on PostgreSQL and SQL for efficient querying and database management. I develop reliable and secure RESTful APIs using Postman for testing, and I manage my source code and repositories on Git. My skill set has expanded to allow me to work on both the frontend and backend of development, making me a versatile and adaptable engineer.

            <br>
            After completing my master's degree in Marketing Analytics, I applied my creativity and ability to organize information to make data-driven decisions as a Senior Product Analyst at Flywheel Digital. I focused on automating and streamlining the incorporation of online retailers' APIs, such as Amazon and Target, into our databases. One of my most impactful projects involved integrating automation into our supply chain team, which boosted profits to over $3 million—a 150% increase from the previous year.

            <br>
            My journey into coding began with managing Scrum teams and planning product roadmaps, where I discovered my passion for building solutions with my development team. This inspired me to dive deeper into coding, and now I’m eager to bring my skills to a professional setting as a full-stack software engineer.

            <br>
            I am currently seeking a Junior Software Developer role, based around Baltimore, MD, but I am open to relocation. I look forward to bringing my strong background in data analysis, automation tools, technical skills, and passion for innovation to create impactful products for your clients. Thank you.
        </p>
